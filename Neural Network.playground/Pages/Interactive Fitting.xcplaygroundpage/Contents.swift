 ## Fitting to Points
 
 **Goal:** Plot some points and train a neural network to fit those points.
 
 Try plotting a few points by tapping the white area. Once you have a few points plotted, hit train a couple times to see how the network "learns" to fit those points. Train multiple times to get a more accurate fit.

 You can try changing the learning rate to see how it affects the network's learning:
*/
let learningRate: Double = 15

// Our network takes 1 input, has 2 hidden layers (15 hidden neurons first, then 5 hidden neurons), and outputs 1 value.
let network = Network(inputs: 1, structure: [15, 5, 1])

// Setup the view.
let interactiveController = InteractiveViewController()
interactiveController.network = network
interactiveController.Î· = learningRate

let navigationController = UINavigationController(rootViewController: interactiveController)
PlaygroundPage.current.liveView = navigationController
